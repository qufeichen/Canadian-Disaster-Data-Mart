The earthquake had a depth of 24 kilometres and struck 129 kilometres outside the city of Sendai, 177 kilometres outside of Fukushima and some 372 kilometres northeast of Tokyo. Tsunami – The earthquake triggered a massive tsunami with waves reaching as high as 40 metres and struck land as far as 10 kilometres inland. Close to 28,000 people were reported dead or missing as a result of the earthquake and tsunami. Japanese authorities estimated the number of people injured as a result of this disaster was over 4000.  Over 220,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.  Costs of damages resulting from the earthquake and tsunami have been estimated at over $300 billion. Nuclear Emergency – The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was severely damaged by the initial earthquake and subsequent tsunami that followed. A nuclear emergency was declared by Japanese authorities following problems with one of the cooling systems. These problems resulted in three major explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant resulting in a level 7 nuclear meltdown. The explosions took place at reactor 1 on March 12, reactor 3 on March 14, and reactor 2 on March 15. On March 14, Japanese Prime Minister Kan announced that the 20 kilometre evacuation zone had been expanded to include a warning for people within 30 kilometres of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The Canadian federal department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) provided potassium Iodide (KI) to staff at the Canadian mission in Tokyo and Health Canada monitored gamma-radiation levels at the Embassy, confirming the absence of significant radiation meaning there was little threat to the health of Embassy staff. The Canadian government’s support to the government of Japan included a disaster victim identification team, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear technical expertise and equipment, Canadian Armed Forces military assets to facilitate humanitarian relief efforts, relief stocks, and emergency medical and engineering capabilities. At the time of the earthquake, there were an estimated 11,000 Canadian citizens present in Japan. One Canadian citizen was confirmed to have been killed as a result of the earthquake and tsunami.

The one infected herd was located on 18 separate properties. Within the infected herd there were six confirmed cases of TB, including the cow that was slaughtered in the United states. The infection resulted in the quarantine of approximately 26,000 cattle from approximately 50 different properties in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. As a precaution, approximately 10,000 cattle were destroyed in order to stop the spread of the infection. The infection significantly impacted farmers in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

In May 2016, wildfires broke out in northern Alberta resulting in the most expensive natural disaster in the history of Canada. The city of Fort McMurray, located in the heart of the Athabasca oil sands, was hit by a massive system of wildfires that swept through the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo. The first wildfire was discovered on April 30, north of Fort McMurray. The Regional Municipality declared a local state of emergency and a mandatory evacuation order for Centennial Park on May 1 as well as another evacuation order for Prairie Creek and Centennial Trailer Park on May 2. The Fort McMurray fire grew rapidly due to hot and dry weather conditions, doubling in size to 2,656 hectares in a manner of hours. On May 3, the wildfire intensified and crossed over Highway 63, cutting off the route to evacuees, prompting the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation to declare a state of local emergency and a mandatory evacuation order for Fort McMurray’s Lower Townsite and downtown area, which included the communities of Gregoire, Beacon Hill, Abasand, Waterways, Draper, Saline Creek, Grayling Terrace, Thickwood, Wood Buffalo and Dickinsfield. Later in the day the entire city of Fort McMurray was under a mandatory evacuation order. During the evacuations two people were killed in a car crash. On May 4, the Alberta government declared a provincial state of emergency. The Fort McMurray fire quickly grew to 85,000 hectares as the wildfire spread further north and east eventually passing through Fort McMurray. Evacuees that fled north of Fort McMurray had to be air lifted to safety. Some evacuees were taken to Lac La Biche, while the majority where sent to Edmonton and Calgary. On May 10, two of the main Fort McMurray fires joined together and formed a massive blaze of 229,000 hectares. On May 16, all workers in work camps and oil sand operations north of Fort McMurray were forced to move south as the wildfire spread further north. Residents of Fort McMurray were allowed to return home on June 1. In total, the Fort McMurray fires burned approximately 579,767 hectares of land causing the evacuation of over 90,000 people and destroyed 2,400 homes and business, including 530 other buildings that were damaged. At its peak, there were over 2000 firefighters working the fires daily, including helicopters and water bombers. In addition, firefighters received help from 200 firefighters from the United States, 60 from Mexico and 298 from South Africa. Firefighters and emergency response personnel received help from the Canadian Red Cross who assisted with evacuation efforts."
