\N	\N	\N	Response and recovery activities began at the time of the event. The ice storm significantly impacted some of Canada’s largest and most densely populated urban municipalities. Municipalities, provincial ministries and non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross all acted to respond to the ice storm. Ontario determined that the impacts of the storm were severe enough to warrant implementation of an Ice Storm Assistance Program to help municipalities and conservation authorities with emergency response and recovery costs. Two deaths were attributed to the storm due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly ventilated generators and heaters.  	\N	\N	128

Violent winds snapped trees, lifted roofs, flattened cars, mowed down fences, collapsed farm buildings, and inflicted property losses around $100 million. The first tornado of the day touched down in the town of Durham in Grey County, killing a young boy as he left a nearby conservation area day camp. About 600 homes, mostly in the communities of Maple and Woodbridge were damaged. Fourty were destroyed and declared unsafe. At the peak of the storm, Hydro One reported that 69,000 customers (approximately 207,000 individuals) had lost power.	Barrie/central	(approximately	northeastward	499
Southern Alberta, August 1-3, 2009. A cold front swept through southern Alberta on August 1, bringing with it strong wind gusts of up to 100 km/h. The powerful winds brought down a stage at the Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose killing one individual and injuring 75 others. Calgary received wind gusts of up to 78 km/h. The strong winds killed a small child and injured two others when debris from a construction site struck the individuals. On August 2 and 3, a powerful storm developed increasing the severity of the strong winds with wind gusts of up to 107 km/h, along with large hail and heavy rain. The power winds downed trees and power lines, knocking out power to an unknown number of people. In some parts of Alberta, hail was measured at 10 cm deep, with some hail the size of baseballs. Hail caused extensive damages to homes and vehicles.	construction	individuals.	baseballs.	500
Notre-Dame-des-Prairies QC, June 28 to July 4, 2009. A quasi-stationary low-pressure system stalled over eastern Ontario and Quebec. Excessive rains of up to 140 mm damaged roads and bridges, and flooded basements.  The hardest hit areas were in Charlevoix, Mauricie and Parent. Flood waters filled 50 houses in Notre-Dame-des-Prairies on July 1, and collapsed a street in Entrelacs when a stream overflowed. The flow rate on several rivers exceeded historic records.

Hamilton and Toronto ON, July 26, 2009. A storm cell stalled over the western end of Lake Ontario. Hamilton was hard hit. Waves of thunderstorms pounded the city, leaving citizens with flooded basements and motorists stuck in traffic caused by road closures. The midday downpour turned Red Hill Creek into an angry brown torrent that forced the closure of nearby roads and highways. Water gushed into 7000 basements and power was shut off to thousands of customers. While the Hamilton Airport observed only 28 mm of rain, radar estimates confirmed rainfall amounts in an unofficial gauge totaling 110 mm in two hours - worse than a 100-year storm and one of the most intense short-duration rainfalls on record in Canada. Conditions were made worse because the ground was super-saturated from storms two days earlier. In Toronto, parts of Lakeshore Boulevard near the Exhibition grounds were submerged. To the north, a pair of giant sinkholes swallowed part of Finch Avenue West - big enough to hold a fleet of cars and deep enough to cover a four-storey building.	super-saturated	short-duration	thunderstorms	502
Montreal, Alma, La Tuque and Baie-Saint-Paul QC, May 14, 2009. Winds gusting up to 100 km/h wreaked havoc across Quebec on May 14. An 18-wheeler was one of six tractor-trailers pushed over on its side near Beloeil. Strong winds cut electricity to 70,000 people by downing hydro lines.  Winds also inflicted significant property damage: in Ste-Julie, winds uprooted hundreds of trees and tossed a gazebo and trampoline into the air where there were left dangling from power lines; in Alma, fallen trees crossed power lines, igniting a brush fire; in the La Tuque region, winds blew shingles off a hotel roof and dropped a street light on a home; and in Baie-Saint-Paul, winds snapped hydro poles in half and tore away roofs.	tractor-trailers	Baie-Saint-Paul,	Baie-Saint-Paul	503
Saint John, Miramichi and Restigouche River NB, April 5 to May 4, 2009.

Manitoba, April-May 1999. There were 65 fires burning in the province.  The 1200 residents of Cross Lake were forced to flee their homes on April 29, when a Forest fire came within 300 metres of the town. The majority of residents were evacuated to the nearby towns of Thompson and Norway House.  On May 3, 600 residents of three small communities clustered on the east shore of Lake Winnipeg (Seymourville, Hollow Water First Nation and Manigotagan), were evacuated to the nearby town of Bissett to avoid the oncoming Forest fire which came within four kilometres of the communities. The fire covered 52 sq. km. and it took about 500 firefighters, 30 helicopters and five water bombers to battle the blaze.	(Seymourville,	Manigotagan),	firefighters,	555
Southern Alberta, June 6-8, 2005. Heavy rainfall and high water levels across southern Alberta caused massive flooding in several waterways.  Multiple municipalities across the region issued a state of emergency. Severe flooding caused the evacuation of 2000 people in Calgary, 1,300 in Sundre, 3,200 in Drumheller, 200 in High River, 70 in Foothills, 58 in Okotoks and 200 in Red Deer County.  Officials reported that the 200-year flood event resulted in significant damages to approximately 40,000 homes.	municipalities	approximately	Drumheller,	556
Northern Saskatchewan, June 23-25,2005.  An intense low pressure system caused heavy rainfall from July 23-25, affecting an area of northern Saskatchewan already saturated by snowmelt between Meadow Lake to the south and Stony Rapids to the north, and between the Alberta border to the west and the Manitoba border to the east.  The closure of Highway 905 due to flooding in several locations resulted in the disruption of services to northern communities, including Stony Rapids and Black Lake, until the road was re-opened on July 31.  Preliminary eligible costs were estimated at $3,200,000, which would result in a federal share of approximately $1,100,000.	approximately	Saskatchewan,	Saskatchewan	557

Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB, March 24 to May 21, 2009. Overland flooding caused by a combination of snowmelt, seasonal precipitation and the spring breakup affected southern Manitobas watershed areas of the Red, Pembina, Assiniboine, and Souris Rivers. The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk. The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts.	infrastructure	precipitation	Assiniboine,	559

Saskatchewan and Alberta, March 1 to July 1, 2009.  The Canadian Wheat Board projected lower crop prospects by 20 per cent across the Prairies. A dozen counties and municipal districts in Alberta declared a state of drought emergency or disaster. For example, Saskatoon had less than one-quarter of the usual amount of spring precipitation, making the months of March, April and May the driest since record-keeping began in 1892. It wasnt just spring that was dry. The soil moisture recharge period between September 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 had less than 60 per cent of normal precipitation. To the west, in Alberta, conditions were even drier, as illustrated by precipitation amounts in Edmonton, where the 12- month total rain and snow from July 2008 to June 2009 was only 234 mm, less than half of normal and the driest such period with records dating back to 1880. Making matters worse, eight of the last ten years in Albertas capital of Edmonton had less rain and snow than the 30-year average total, but no year was as scanty as the most recent. Not surprisingly, the flow of the North Saskatchewan River was at its third lowest level in nearly a century.	precipitation.	precipitation,	record-keeping	560

Labrador City NL, January 19, 1982. Leading up to the January 18th event, temperatures were in the -12 to -35 degrees Celsius range.  On the 18th, temperatures decreased further to the -30 to -40 degrees Celsius range.  Winds from the west were 65 km/hr with wind gusts up to 111 km/hr occurring during the evening hours.  This resulted in wind chills of -53 to -58 degrees Celsius.  Heavy snowfall and high winds reduced visibility to near zero, and were the cause of a power outage at the Harrie Lake Trailer Court.  The outage left residents without heat or hydro, and the extreme cold caused water pipes to freeze and burst within a majority of the residences.  The Mayor declared a local state of emergency, loaders and dump trucks were brought in to create access routes, and 2,000 residents of the trailer park were evacuated to A.P. Lowe School.	temperatures	residences.	visibility	894

British Columbia, July 1 to September 30, 2014. A significant heat wave across British Columbia in July and August led to record breaking dry conditions and “high” to “extreme” fire danger ratings in most of the province. Almost 360,000 hectares of land was burned –the third highest in the history of the province. Over 4,500 people were forced to evacuate throughout the season with the largest evacuations taking place in West Kelowna where 2,500 people fled and Hudson’s Hope where 1,150 people fled in July due to wildfires. At its peak, over 3000 firefighters and frontline crews worked at combating the fires, and as a result, significant damage to infrastructure and communities was avoided. As of November 2014, the Government of British Columbia estimated it spent approximately $300 million dollars responding to wildfires for the 2014 season.	infrastructure	approximately	firefighters	1019
Northwest Territories, July 1 to September 18, 2014. Abnormally dry conditions and high temperatures fed peak wildfire conditions during the 2014 fire season.

Quesnel Lake BC, August 4-12, 2014. The dam for the tailings pond at the Imperial Metals Mount Polley copper and gold mine breached; releasing nearly 10 million cubic metres of water and 4.5 million cubic metres of contaminated slurry into nearby Polley Lake, Hazeltine Creek, Cariboo Creek and Quesnel Lake. On August 6, the Cariboo Regional District declared a local state of emergency in several nearby communities due to concerns over the quality of drinking water, affecting over 300 residents. By August 12, the BC Government lifted the ban on drinking water for many homes with the exception of those within 100 metres of the sediment deposit. A final report commissioned by the BC Government attributed the dam failure to a design flaw, where the foundation was built upon unstable glacial till, exacerbated by the dam being repeatedly raised and expanded.	commissioned	contaminated	exacerbated	1023
Ottawa ON, Oct 22, 2014. At approximately 09:52 EDT, an armed gunman (Michael Zehaf-Bibeau) pulled up in his vehicle to the Ottawa National War Memorial where three Canadian Armed Forces members were posted on Ceremonial Guard sentry duty. Zehaf-Bibeau shot at Cpl. Nathan Cirillo striking him twice in the back and fatally wounding him. Zehaf-Bibeau then fired at the other sentries as he fled towards the Parliament buildings; but neither of the other sentries was struck or injured. Pulling up to Parliament Hill, Zehaf-Bibeau ran from his car and carjacked an idling Parliamentary vehicle on the hill. Members of the RCMP began pursuit as he pulled the vehicle up and ran into the front doors of Parliament. Upon entering, Zefaf-Bibeau engaged in a struggle with House of Commons Security Guard Samearn Son, who was shot in the foot in the ensuing struggle. Zehaf-Bibeau fled further into the Parliament buildings and was fatally shot by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, Kevin Vickers. In the ensuing search for additional shooters, many federal government buildings and offices were placed in lockdown. Public institutions such as the University of Ottawa and nearby schools were also placed in lockdown. There were false reports that a third shooting had taken place at the Rideau Centre Mall, fueled by high cellular phone and social media usage that also strained cell towers and communications infrastructure. Government employees were asked to restrict their Blackberry usage for emergencies only until the crisis was over to reduce burden on the system. The following day, Prime Minister Stephen Harper classified the attack as terrorism.	Sergeant-at-Arms	infrastructure.	communications	1024
L’Isle-Verte QC, January 23 to February 1 , 2014. A fire broke out overnight in the kitchen of the Résidence du Havre nursing home that housed 52 seniors with limited mobility. A combination of a lack of installed sprinklers and the wooden construction of the building contributed to the intensity of the fire. Twenty-eight bodies were recovered during the initial search and another four were classified as missing and presumed dead. There were 15 injuries mostly caused by smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. In addition, two firefighters were treated for minor injuries. The official Coroner’s report issued February 2015 cited a lack of adequate evacuation and emergency plans, a lack of trained personnel on duty at the facility, and a delay in the firefighter response and backup as factors that contributed to the severity of the disaster. The fire was classified as an accident and no criminal investigation was commenced.	investigation	L’Isle-Verte	Twenty-eight	1025

Alberta and Saskatchewan, July 22, 2015. Severe thunderstorms affected the southern Alberta region before moving into Saskatchewan. A storm system southwest of Calgary produced a small tornado that touched down in the Tsuu T’ina Nation at 12:53 MTZ as well as multiple funnel clouds, which were spotted in the Calgary area. The impact of the tornado was minimal, however the proximity of the tornado to a highly populated area like Calgary created an extremely high level of risk. Southern areas of Calgary including Canyon Meadows and Lake Bonavista were hit with large hail and as the storm moved east, Hussar, Patricia and Strathmore were impacted by strong wind gusts that downed trees over power lines resulting in localized power outages. A severe thunderstorm warning was in effect at the time meaning that wind gusts exceeded 90 km/h and hail was greater than two cm. The storm later reached Saskatchewan where the town of Kerrobert was hit with severe hail, prompting a state of emergency to be declared. Other communities in Saskatchewan such as Anglin Lake, Francis, Sedley and Regina were impacted by strong winds, heavy rain, hail and lighting.
